*This is a paid feature*

Organizations enable you to manage groups of users across multiple sites. Teams or individuals within an organization can have their access-levels applied on a per-site basis.

## Create an Organization

You can create an organization on your dashboard by clicking on _Create Organization_ in the left sidebar.
Once you filled in your information and named the organization you can proceed by clicking on _Create_.

The Organization you created will now show up underneath _My sites_ in the left sidebar. You can access the Organization's sites and settings by clicking on the Organization.

Depending on your role in this organization your dashboard may vary, please read more in different [user roles](/docs/settings/team-management/#site-access-levels) to see what your assigned role allows you to do.

Before managing the sites permissions, you have to add owners and members to your organization.

Users can only be managed in Organization settings. Organizations are collections of sites assigned to teams and collaborators.
Organizations can have multiple users with different [user roles](#site-access-levels) work across all sites of an organization.

## Add Users to an organization

To add Users, go to your organization settings and click _add User_.

Enter the email, set if this person should be an **owner** or a **member** or the organization.

## Teams

Once you have added members to an organization, you can create teams to define default permissions for team members on each site.

### Create Teams

Click on _Add Team_ button to add a new team to an organization, then enter the desired team name and click _Create_.
