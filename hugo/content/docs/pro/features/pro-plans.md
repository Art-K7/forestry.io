Organizations on the Pro Plan have access to certain enterprise features, please [contact us](https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/dan67/forestry-cms) if you would like to upgrade your plan.

## Subdomains

Users within a pro organization will access the app through `*organization-subdomain*.forestry.io` instead of `app.forestry.io`. A separate user account will be created for each of a users subdomains.<br /><br />
For example: If I am an active Forestry.io user, and I am invited to join **Pro Org A**, a separate user account will be created scoped to **Pro Org A**, which I can access through `pro-org-a.forestry.io`.
