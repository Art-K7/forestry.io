**We will be sunsetting deployments on January 1st, 2020**

We started removing support for deployments (FTP, GitHub Pages, Amazon S3) on all newly created sites back in August.

Deployments will continue to work for existing sites until January 1st, 2020; we encourage people to move to dedicated deployment services like [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Buddy Works](https://buddy.works),[Zeit now](https://zeit.co) or [Circle CI](https://circleci.com).

### Why this change? 

Only a small percentage of our users make use of Forestry deployments. For those users, we spend a lot of effort ensuring build and deployments work. We prefer to focus on our core features like content modelling and the editing experience. Plus, dedicated services are doing a far better job at deployment and allow for scheduled jobs for instance; we think our users will be better off using those services.   
  
Even if the current option has served you well until now, we think it's a smart move for everyone.
