Starting today, we're removing support for deployments. 
All newly created sites won't be offered to use former deployments options (FTP, GitHub Pages, Amazon S3).

Existing sites are encouraged to move to best-of-breeds services like [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Circle CI](https://circleci.com).

Why this change? Because it involves a lot of machinery on our end to ensure a build pipeline for you and given only a few percents of our users are effectively using this option, we think it's better for us to focus on our core features like content modeling and editing experience. Plus you will benefit from better services and features from companies that do deployment for a living.   
Even if the current option has served you well until now, we think it's a smart move for everyone.

**We will be sunsetting deployments on January 1st, 2020**
