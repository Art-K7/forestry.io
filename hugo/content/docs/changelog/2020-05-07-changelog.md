### Enhancements

* **Group branches in the dashboard**: Branches from the same repository are now grouped in the dashboard, you can switch, remove and transfer branches. This does not change the fact that branches have to be added from your Git repository first, before being imported to Forestry.
* **Snippets per section (opt-in)**: Teams looking to use different snippets per section have now the possibility to group snippets by mirroring the folder structure of their sections. (eg. `.forestry/snippets/_posts/figure.snippet` or `.forestry/snippets/content/posts/figure.snippets).`

### Fixes

* Refresh view after a media upload or deletion.
* Swap netlify.com with new netlify.app domain for site using Netlify Large Media
*
