### Deprecation

* **Deployments:** New sites can no longer be deployed by Forestry. Existing sites have until the end of the year to move to a dedicated CI/CD platform. Read our sunset notice.
* As a result, **Standard Previews** are also deprecated in favor of **Instant Previews** for new sites**.** Existing sites still using standard previews have until the end of the year to make the switch.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug preventing to use **Create template from Page** 
* Sanitize media filenames to **prevent failed media uploads**
