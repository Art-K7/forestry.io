### Enhancements

* **Starters**: Newcomers can now [pick one of our starters](https://forestry.io/starters/ "Get started with Forestry") for Gatsby, Gridsome, Eleventy, Next, VuePress, Hugo or Jekyll. It's mostly a way to show how Forestry displays content sections, data files and how to configure Instant previews.   
  If you're a theme developer and that yo have a working theme setup and ready for Forestry, feel free to [submit your starter on GitHub](https://github.com/forestryio/forestry.io/issues/new?assignees=DirtyF&labels=starter&template=starter.md&title=New+starter+submission).

### Fixes

* Listing organizations sites for external editors
* Show last user sign in for organizations using SSO
