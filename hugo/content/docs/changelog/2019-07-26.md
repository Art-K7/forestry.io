### Bug fixes

* **Folders synchronization**: Renamed and moved folders outside of Forestry are now properly synched. Content sections will auto update after every import.
* **Instant Previews**:
  * Default command for JS-based static site generators should be run as an npm script (`npm run forestry:preview` by default now). As the different cli packages are not installed globally, this will avoid errors on not finding Gatsby, VuePress.
  * Environment variables like GIT_ now properly sent
  * **Git LFS**:

### Enhancements

* **Hugo**: Latest Hugo version (`0.56.0`) is available on site import and for Instant Previews.
* **Instant Previews**: 
  * A new `Ruby 2.6 + Node 10` image for people using Jekyll and node packages or plugins like jekyll-assets is available.
  * **Hibernation**: In order to save resources, preview environment will be put to sleep 2 hours after the last activity on a site, and will be put out of sleep on new activity.

### Deprecation

* **FTP Deployments**: New imported sites can not build and publish through FTP anymore.
