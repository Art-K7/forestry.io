If you are using the **personal** plan and have some sites and branches that are **inactive for more than three months**, we will automatically archive those to save some resources on our servers.

Don't worry you can always **restore** an archived branch whenever you came back to edit your site.

![Forestry Dashboard with archived sites](/uploads/2020/06/archived-sites.png)

Click on the site or branch marked as _archived_ and click on the **Restore now** button.![Restore archived site dialog](/uploads/2020/06/restore-modal.png)

Your branch or site is now active again. ðŸ˜€
