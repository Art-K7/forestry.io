If you are using the **personal** plan and **didn't edit your site branch for more than three months**, we will automatically archive it in order to save some precious resources on our servers.

Don't worry site admins can always **restore** an archived branch in two clicks the next time your try to access it.

![Forestry Dashboard with archived sites](/uploads/2020/06/archived-sites.png)

Click on the site or branch marked as _archived_ and click on the **Restore now** button.![Restore archived site dialog](/uploads/2020/06/restore-modal.png)

Your branch or site is now active again. ðŸ˜€
