Forestry will use whatever version of Jekyll is specified in your `Gemfile`.

If you don't have a `Gemfile`, you'll have to run `bundle init` on your machine then `bundle add jekyll` to use latest Jekyll.

GiHub Pages currently run Jekyll 3.8.6, but you can [use Jekyll 4.x on GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/).
