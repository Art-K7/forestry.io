Static sites are websites built using static, unchanging files. They require no server processing time to deliver the content to the user, which makes them very fast and performant.

Static site generators are the modern way of building static sites. They convert simple, text-based [content files](/docs/faqs/glossary/content-files/) in static files ready for the web.

Theyâ€™re fantastic for developers because they are extremely fast, are built to work with version-control, and require little-to-no setup compared to existing monolithic CMS solutions like Wordpress.
