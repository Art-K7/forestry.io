If your website uses submodules from private repos, you will need to configure your site to allow Forestry to access these submodules. For sites stored on **GitHub** or **GitLab**, our _quick setup_ flow will not grant the correct permissions. This flow adds a **deploy key** to your GitHub or GitLab repo, which only grants access to a single repository and will not allow Forestry to install private submodules.

To use a site containing private submodules with Forestry, you must [manually import](/docs/git-sync/manual-setup/) the site. If you've already imported the site using the _quick setup_ flow, remove the site and re-import it manually using our [manual setup instructions](/docs/git-sync/manual-setup/). Then, grab the public key from **Settings > Repository** and add it to your GitHub or GitLab user account instead of creating a deploy key in the repository.

**This will give Forestry access to all of your user's repos.** If you would prefer not to do that, just create a new GitHub/GitLab user with access to all of the necessary repositories and add the key to their account.

Note that this is typically not an issue for projects stored on Bitbucket because you must add Forestry's public key to your user account (deploy keys are read-only.) If you're having trouble installing private Bitbucket submodules, ensure your Bitbucket user has access to all of the necessary repositories.
