Forestry provides multiple options for media storage.

## Git

The most basic option for storing media is to commit it to your git repo like the rest of your content. This is the default setting for new projects.

If your site has a large number of media files, we highly recommend [implementing Git LFS on your repository](https://forestry.io/blog/versioning-large-files-with-git-lfs/). Forestry will be able to handle Git LFS media for repositories hosted on GitHub and GitLab.

## Cloudinary

Forestry can use [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to store your media files. With Cloudinary, you have the advantage of easy image manipulation directly in your templates.
