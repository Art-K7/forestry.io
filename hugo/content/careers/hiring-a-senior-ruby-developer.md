title: Senior Ruby/RoR Software Engineer
description: Forestry.io is a content management system for static websites built
  with tools like Jekyll, Hugo and Gatsby (static site generators).  Developers around
  the world are leaving WordPress and Drupal for more secure, performant, static sites
  and Forestry allows their non-technical teams to manage content.  Forestry takes
  a Git-based approach to content management. When content is edited in Forestry,
  all updates are saved as commits in the Git repo for that site.  Our product is
  a Rails application and we are currently seeking a senior Rails developer to join
  the team and help us continue to build out the product.
