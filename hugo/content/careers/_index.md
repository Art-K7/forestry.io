We’re a small, growing team, headquartered in Canada with roughly half our staff working remotely from North America and Europe. We take our time hiring, and we hire for the person, not simply for the role. We’re a diverse team that values collaboration, respect and empathy. We strive to reflect those values in our hiring process.  
<br/>

### Our Hiring Process

Our process involves multiple steps, the first being an introductory chat to gauge mutual interest and gain clarity into each another’s needs and expectations. If it feels like a good fit, we’ll schedule a “Life Story” interview. Our goal in this step is to learn what you value, what motivates you, and how you’ve grown into the person you are today. After getting to know you better, we then hold a series of interviews with various team members with the goal of examining the depth and breadth of your skillset. We like to think about your skills and areas for potential growth both in the context of the role and in the broader context of our company as a whole. In the last step, we’ll have a diverse group of people review and discuss our applicants before making a decision.
