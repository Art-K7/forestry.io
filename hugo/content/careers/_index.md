We’re a small, growing team, headquartered in Canada with roughly half our staff working remotely from North America and Europe. We take our time hiring, and we hire for the person, not simply for the role. We’re a diverse team that values collaboration, respect and empathy. We strive to reflect those values in our hiring process.  
<br/>

### Our Hiring Process

Our process involves an introductory chat to see if we’re a good match for each other and ought to proceed. Then, each candidate that enters our interview process will do a Life Story interview where we’ll dive deeper into your story to get to know you better. We’d like to learn what you value, what motivates you, and how you’ve grown into the person you are today. This will be followed by a series of interviews where we’ll take a closer look at the depth and breadth of the skills you’ll be using on the job. Lastly, we’ll have a diverse group of people review and discuss our applicants before making a decision.
