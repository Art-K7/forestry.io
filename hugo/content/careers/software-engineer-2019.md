title: Software Engineer (React/Rails)
description: Forestry.io is a content management system for static websites built
  with tools like Jekyll, Hugo and Gatsby (static site generators).  Developers around
  the world are leaving WordPress and Drupal for more secure, performant, static sites
  and Forestry allows their non-technical teams to manage content.  Forestry takes
  a Git-based approach to content management. When content is edited in Forestry,
  all updates are saved as commits in the Git repo for that site.  Our product is
  a Rails application and we are currently seeking a senior Rails developer to join
  the team and help us continue to build out the product.

At Forestry, we’re _helping people build a better web_. Our **Software Engineer's** mission is to help build a CMS for the next era of the web. If you're aligned with our mission, enjoy solving complex problems, and like shipping features with a cross-functional team, this could be the perfect role for you.

We are looking for an engineer who can have an impact across our stack -from our React front-end to our Rails back-end, **with more emphasis on the front-end**. In depth experience with both frameworks is not required, but the more experience with these or similar frameworks, the better.

We strive to create a workplace that enables mastery, autonomy, and purpose (from [Daniel Pink's work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgGhSOAtAyQ)).

This is a **remote** role. <!--more-->

We prefer candidates within GMT -7 and GMT +2 (inclusive) and will not likely consider applicants outside of these bounds unless it's a very strong-looking candidate who is willing to shift their hours to provide some overlap with the rest of our team.

### What You'll Do

* Design, build and maintain features for our CMS using efficient, reusable and reliable JavaScript/React and Ruby/Rails code
* Identify problems with the application and code base on your own and suggest/provide solutions
* Help maintain code quality, organization and automation
* Work on a cross-functional team, providing input to and helping out in areas beyond coding (helping define requirements, testing, technical documentation)

### To Be Successful In This Role, You'll Need

* A minimum of 2 years experience building and designing web applications
* Experience developing with JavaScript and a front-end framework (React preferred)
* Experience working on the back-end of a web application
* To be driven by solving hard problems and taking ownership over development tasks
* To take initiative and suggest solutions and improvements
* A solid understanding and appreciation for automated tests
* To be proficient in the English language, both written and verbal

**Extra consideration will be given for candidates that:**

* Have experience across more of our technical stack (JavaScript/React, GraphQL, Ruby/Rails, Kubernetes, terraform, AWS)
* Have experience with static site generators
* Have a passion for the solving the needs of our users
