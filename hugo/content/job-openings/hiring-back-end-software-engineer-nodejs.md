We’re looking for a software engineer to help us build [TinaCMS Teams](https://tinacms.org/teams "TinaCMS Teams"), our pro back-end for the recently open-sourced [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org "TinaCMS"). You’ll work on building and scaling our NodeJS back-end: the API, databases, infrastructure and integrations with 3rd party services. You’ll also work on the open source project TinaCMS. The person in this role will have a lot of autonomy on a small team with the goal of bringing the best editing experience (TinaCMS) to larger teams.

* This position is for a full-time employee.
* This is a remote role (UTC -8 to UTC -2). We are open to extending our range to UTC +1 for the right candidate.

### Techs You'll Work With

* JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS (KOA), Postgres, AWS, Google Cloud, Kubernetes & more.

### To Be Successful in this Role, You'll Need

* To be strong with JavaScript, TypeScript and the JS ecosystem.
* Previous experience building and scaling a back-end system in the cloud (bonus points for working with NodeJS -KOA or Express).
* Familiarity with Docker and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

### About Forestry.io

Forestry.io is on a mission to help people build a better web. We’re building a Git-backed content management system (CMS) and an open source site-editing toolkit ([TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org "TinaCMS")) -both focused on the JAMstack.

We’re a small, growing team, headquartered in PEI, Canada with roughly half our staff working remotely. We take our time hiring, and we hire for the person, not simply for the role. We value collaboration, respect and empathy and we strive to reflect those values in our hiring process.

### Apply

Each job posting has a list of things that we believe will help you be successful. You don’t need to be a “rockstar” at everything on day 1. In fact, humility, initiative & positive attitude are more important and we’re willing to help you acquire skills that you may be lacking. Keep that in mind when considering whether to apply.

We value diversity on our team and strongly encourage applicants from under-represented groups in the software industry to apply.

We invite interested candidates to contact [careers@forestry.io](mailto:careers@forestry.io) and include your:

* Resume/CV
* Cover Letter
* LinkedIn or other relevant social accounts that describe your professional experience
* Links to your personal website, blog or portfolios (if available and applicable).
