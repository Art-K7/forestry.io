This is a reminder that Forestry will be permanently discontinued on the morning of April 22, 2023.

At that time, your site will not be impacted (it will not “go down”). However, you will lose the ability to edit your site’s content  using Forestry.io.

If you haven't chosen a new CMS yet, we would be thrilled to see you switch to our new CMS, Tina.io.  If you haven’t seen Tina yet, here’s a 4-minute demo video:

## Migrating to TinaCMS

We just released a significant update to our CLI migration tool and most Forestry features are now supported in Tina. Tina supports all frameworks (Hugo, Jekyll, Next, Gatsby, etc) and we’re continuing to pour our hearts into making Tina a great CMS.

To use the CLI migration tool, we recommend you run the following command on a new branch: 
```
npx @tinacms/cli@latest init
```
When it asks you if you want to migrate your forestry folder please answer `y` for yes. 

See the [full migration guide](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/overview/) for more details.

Feel free to hop into Tina’s [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) if you have any questions.

## Development Services
If you would like assistance migrating your site or if your company needs help developing another unrelated development project, we have a team of experts and would be happy to help. Please contact [info@forestry.io](mailto:info@forestry.io) for a quote.  

Again, thank you for your patience as we built the next iteration of our vision.
