This is a reminder that Forestry will be permanently discontinued on the morning of April 22, 2023.

At that time, your site will not be impacted (it will not “go down”). However, you will lose the ability to edit your site’s content  using Forestry.io.

If you haven't chosen a new CMS yet, we would be thrilled to see you switch to our V2 product, Tina.io.  If you haven’t seen Tina yet, here’s a (semi-technical) 4-minute demo video

## Migrating to TinaCMS

Most Forestry features are now supported in Tina and we’re continuing to pour our hearts into making it a great CMS.  Tina supports all frameworks (Hugo, Jekyll, Next, Gatsby, etc) and just released a significant update to our CLI migration tool.  To use the tool, we recommend you create a new branch and run this command: `npx @tinacms/cli@latest init`. When it asks you if you want to migrate your forestry folder please answer `y` for yes. 

The full migration guide can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/overview/): 

Here is a video walkthrough of the migration process:

If you would like assistance migrating your site, please contact [info@forestry.io](mailto:info@forestry.io) for a quote.  Also, if you're interested in general development services, we have a team of experts and often help companies with projects of all sizes. 

Again, thank you for your patience as we built the next iteration of our vision.
